Dear Omegans,
 
If Medical Allowance is a component of your monthly salary (Rs.1250/- per month) and if you wish to claim Tax benefit for the same, you are requested to submit Medical Bills to your Location HR / Payroll Team on or before 10th March 2017.  
 
Non-receipt of Medical Bills within the cut-off date will lead to Tax deduction in the March 2017 salary. Tax will be deducted on the entire Medical Allowance (Rs.15000/- pa) paid so far through your monthly salary. 
 
Medical Bills Criteria:
 
•         Only original Medical bills should be submitted
•         Medical bills should be in the name of self, spouse, children & dependent parents only. Medical bills in the name of non-dependents will not be considered for Tax exemption
•         All Medical Bills should carry a date falling in the current financial year (Apr ’16 to Mar ‘17) only. For Omegans who have joined in the current FY, bills should carry a date which falls on or after your date of joining Omega
•         Any Non-Medical Items like Soaps, Shampoo, Baby Napkins, Talc Power, Tooth Brush, Paste, facial cream etc. will not be considered for tax exemption.
o   However, if any of the above listed item/s are prescribed by a Doctor under any specific treatment, the same can be considered for tax exemption. You must attach a doctor prescription along with the bill in order for us to consider.
•         Medical bills over-written with bill-date or values will be rejected.
 
Please find attached the submission form (cover sheet) for submitting your medical Bills.
 
Kindly co-operate by submitting your medicals bills on-time.
